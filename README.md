# Automated-Response-and-classification-of-infant-cries-based-on-deep-learning-techniques
## Abstract
This project aims on creating a baby monitoring system which is able to classify the live recording samples of the audio cry into 5 different classes which are hunger,pain,laugh,normal and noise.
After it predicts the reason for an infant's cry it will send a messasge via whatsapp through the web along with a photo as well as the audio sample it has just recorded.
The automation of sending whatspp messages is done using Selenium.
The whole automation part of recording and classifying is done on a raspberry pi 4b running the latest version of Raspbian OS.
This project can also be replicated on a Windows machine with a few modifications.
